    "Compared to the raw probabilities, the ratio of probabilities is better able to distinguish relevant words from irrelevant words.

In the example above, the ratio between ice and steam for `k=solid` is large and for `k=gas` is small, indicating that `solid` is related to ice but `gas` is irrelevant. On the other hand, `water` is not a discriminating element between them, and therefore the ratio is close to one. The same applies to an irrelevant word like `fashion`.\n",
